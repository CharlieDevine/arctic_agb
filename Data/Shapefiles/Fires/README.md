## Criteria for selecting individual fire areas
1)  Within the ABoVE extended domain.
2)  Occurred sometime from 2008 to 2013, which is roughly the middle of the full timeseries (2003-2016). This allowed for sufficient pre/post-fire timeseries analysis.
3)  Larger than 62500 hectares, which is the approximate area of one 0.25-degree pixel.

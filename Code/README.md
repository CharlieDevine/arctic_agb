## R scripts for analysis and data preprocessing

### Preprocessing scripts (prepare datasets for analysis)
- Spatial aggregation and resampling to 0.25-deg pixel resolution
- Reprojection to geographic coordinates (WGS84) if needed
- Temporal aggregation to mean of growing season (1 Jun - 31 Oct)
  
### Analysis
- AGB_VM calibration/evaluation with ESA CCI AGB product for 2017 and 2010 (cal/eval years, respectively)
- Spaital intercomparison of AGB products for ABoVE domain and for vegetation cover classes 
- Pre- and post-wildfire disturbance sensitivity analysis and AGB product intercomparison years 2006-2010
- Temporal trends (percent change 2003 vs. 2012; Mann-Kendall Sen's Slope 2003-2012) (pixel-wise and aggregated for vegetation cover classes) AGB product intercomparison
